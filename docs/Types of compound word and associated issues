Types of compound word and associated issues

open compound
foo bar   in dic
1. 'foo' and or 'bar' not in dic  (both foo and/or bar will be marked as spelling errors)
2. 'foo' and 'bar in dic (sweet)
3. 'foo-bar' in dic (probably no occurence)
4. 'foo-bar' not in dic (foo-bar could be REP to foo_bar) - good idea I think. Probably
also need to add foo and bar if they are not present in the dic. Compound only FLAG perhaps, but
that probably won't work.

hyphenated compound
foo-bar in dic
5. 'foo' and or 'bar' not in dic (shouldn't be a problem) - ok
6. 'foo' and 'bar' in dic (as above) - ok but will mean that effectively
this will allow foo bar to exist without spelling errors.
7. 'foo bar' in dic (probably no occurence)
8. 'foo bar' not in dic (can't rep from open to hyphenated. I don't believe) (see comment associated with 6 above)

mixed compound
foo-bar baz
deal with the other 2 first but very similar to open compound
