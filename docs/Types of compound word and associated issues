Types of compound word and associated issues

Case is an issue
Want to ensure (if possible) that any Capitalised words do not allow in their
uncapitalised equivalents (unless they are in the dic too)

open compound
foo bar   in dic
1. 'foo' and or 'bar' not in dic  (both foo and/or bar will be marked as spelling errors)
2. 'foo' and 'bar' in dic (sweet)
3. 'foo-bar' in dic (probably no occurence) - good to check 
4. 'foo-bar' not in dic (foo-bar could be REP to foo_bar) - good idea I think. Probably
also need to add foo and bar if they are not present in the dic. Compound only FLAG perhaps, but that probably won't work.

Do open compounds get suggested? Yes I think so. Need a test to show they do.
Do open compounds always get suggested from their hypenated equivalent? Again, need a test.
If not then add to .aff file



hyphenated compound
foo-bar in dic
5. 'foo' and or 'bar' not in dic (shouldn't be a problem) - ok
6. 'foo' and 'bar' in dic (as above) - ok but will mean that effectively
this will allow foo bar to exist without spelling errors.
7. 'foo bar' in dic (probably no occurence)
8. 'foo bar' not in dic (can't rep from open to hyphenated. I don't believe) (see comment associated with 6 above)

mixed compound
foo-bar baz
deal with the other 2 first but very similar to open compound
